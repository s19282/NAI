In late financial issues led to the Crusader army conducting the Siege of Zara sacking the Catholic city of Zara Zadar on the Adriatic Sea which was then brought under Venetian control When the pope heard of this he excommunicated the Crusader army In January en route to Jerusalem the Crusader leadership entered into an agreement with the Byzantine prince Alexios Angelos to divert the Crusade to Constantinople and restore his deposed father Isaac II Angelos as emperor The intent of the Crusaders was then to continue to Jerusalem with promised Byzantine financial and military aid On June the main Crusader army reached Constantinople while other contingents perhaps a majority of all crusaders continued to Acre
In August following the Siege of Constantinople Alexios was crowned coemperor However in January he was deposed by a popular uprising The Crusaders were no longer able to receive their promised payments from Alexios Following the murder of Alexios on February the Crusaders decided on the outright conquest of the city In April they captured and plundered the citys enormous wealth Only a handful of the Crusaders continued to the Holy Land thereafter

The Fourth Crusade is considered to have solidified the EastWest Schism and dealt an irrevocable blow contributing to the decline of the Byzantine Empire paving the way for Muslim conquests in Anatolia and the Balkans in the coming centuries
