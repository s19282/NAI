The Jefferson Memorial is a presidential memorial built in Washington DC between and under the sponsorship of President Franklin D Roosevelt For Roosevelt it was a suitable memorial to the Founding Father of the United States and the founder of the DemocraticRepublican Party Thomas Jefferson
The neoclassical Memorial building is situated in West Potomac Park on the shore of the Tidal Basin off the Washington Channel of the Potomac River It was designed by the architect John Russell Pope and built by the Philadelphia contractor John McShain Construction of the building began in and was completed in The bronze statue of Jefferson was added in 
Pope made references to the Roman Pantheon and Jeffersons own design for the Rotunda at the University of Virginia The Jefferson Memorial and the White House located directly north form one of the main anchor points in the area of the National Mall in DC The Washington Monument just east of the axis on the national Mall was intended to be located at the intersection of the White House and the site for the Jefferson Memorial to the south but soft swampy ground which defied th century engineering required it be sited to the east 
The Jefferson Memorial is managed by the National Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior under its National Mall and Memorial Parks division In it was ranked fourth on the List of Americas Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects 
It became apparent that the site was well suited for another highprofile memorial since it sat directly south of the White House By the Senate Park Commission better known as the McMillan Commission had proposed placing a Pantheonlike structure on the site hosting the statues of the illustrious men of the nation or whether the memory of some individual shall be honored by a monument of the first rank may be left to the future no action was ever taken by Congress on this issue 
The completion of the Tidal Basin Inlet Bridge in helped to facilitate the recreational usage of East and West Potomac Parks In large liquidchlorine dispensers were installed under the bridge to treat the water and make the Tidal Basin also known as Twining Lake suitable for swimming The Tidal Basin Beach on the site of the future Memorial opened in May and operated as a Whites Only facility until when it was permanently closed to avoid the question of racial integration 
A design competition was held for a memorial to Theodore Roosevelt in The winning design was submitted by John Russell Pope and consisted of a halfcircle memorial situated next to a circular basin The plan was never funded by Congress and was not built 
The Memorials chance came in when President Franklin Roosevelt an admirer of Jefferson in large part because of the book on Jefferson of his friend Claude G Bowers inquired to the Commission of Fine Arts about the possibility of erecting a memorial to Jefferson including it in the plans for the Federal Triangle project which was under construction at the time Later the same year Congressman John J Boylan jumped off FDRs starting point and urged Congress to create the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Commission Boylan was appointed the Commissions first chairman and Congress eventually appropriated million for a memorial to Jefferson 
Jefferson warns that a nation cannot be ignorant and free
The Commission chose John Russell Pope as the architect in Pope was also the architect of the National Archives Building and original west building of the National Gallery of Art He prepared four different plans for the project each on a different site One was on the Anacostia River at the end of East Capitol Street one at Lincoln Park one on the south side of the National Mall across from the National Archives and one situated on the Tidal Basin directly south of the White House The Commission preferred the site on the Tidal Basin mainly because it was the most prominent site and because it completed the fourpoint plan called for by the McMillan Commission Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol White House to the Tidal Basin site Pope designed a very large pantheonlike structure to sit on a square platform and to be flanked by two smaller rectangular colonnaded buildings
