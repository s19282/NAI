Role in the dechristianization of France
Chaumette is considered one of the ultraradical enrages of the French Revolution He demanded the formation of a Revolutionary Army which was to force avarice and greed to yield up the riches of the earth in order to redistribute wealth and feed troops and the urban populations He is associated much more with his views on the deChristianization movement however Chaumette was an ardent critic of Christianity which he charged with consisting of ridiculous ideas that have been very helpful to legitimize despotism In his views he was heavily influenced by atheist and materialist writers Paul dHolbach Denis Diderot and Jean Meslier Chaumette saw religion as a relic of superstitious eras that did not reflect the intellectual achievements of the Age of Enlightenment Indeed for Chaumette church and counterrevolution were one and the same Thus he proceeded to pressure several priests and bishops into abjuring their positions Chaumette organized a Festival of Reason on November which boasted a Goddess of Reason portrayed by an actress on an elevated platform in the Notre Dame Cathedral Chaumette was so passionately involved in the deChristianization process that in December he even publicly changed his name from PierreGaspard Chaumette to Anaxagoras Chaumette He stated his reason for changing his name that I was formerly called PierreGaspard Chaumette because my godfather believed in the saints Since the revolution I have taken the name of a saint who was hanged for his republican principles It has been suggested that his criticism was also influenced by the Churchs stance on homosexual relations
