Containment measures
The Lazzaretto on the Isolotto now Manoel Island which was built in the th century on the site of an isolation hospital used in the plague
In the Infermeria delle Schiavi of Birgu a hospital for galley slaves which had previously housed the Sacra Infermeria before its transfer to Valletta in was converted into an isolation hospital When the epidemic was on the decline by early its patients were transferred into a private house and the temporary hospital was closed in February 
After the outbreak became more severe in March Grand Master Hugues Loubenx de Verdalle requested assistance from the Viceroy of Sicily who sent the Pietro Parisi from Trapani a doctor who had experience with contagious diseases Upon the latters arrival on May he took control of dealing with the outbreak along with the Health Commissioners and the Maltese doctor Gregorio Mamo A temporary isolation hospital was set up on the island in Marsamxett Harbour known as the Isolotto which later became known as Manoel Island suspected and confirmed cases were sent there and they were kept separate from each other The rest of the population was told to selfisolate in their own houses with only one person per family being allowed to go out daily for errands These measures was enforced with harsh penalties including flogging and death 
Washing places near the sea were set up in Valletta Birgu and Senglea allowing suspected cases to wash in an attempt to purify themselves and their clothes Walls of houses with confirmed or suspected cases of the disease were washed with seawater and whitewashed with lime and similar measures were undertaken in burial grounds In the capital dogs were killed but cats were not since they were seen as useful in controlling the rat population even though at the time it was not known that rats were the cause of the disease 
The epidemic began to subside by June and attempts were made to purify the island to remove any traces of the disease which might have been left The temporary hospital was demolished in October and pratique was granted in January
